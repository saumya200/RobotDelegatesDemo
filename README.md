 # Robot Delegate Demo - Learn C# Delegates in an easier way!

 This is a fun and beginner-friendly C# console app that demonstrates how **Delegates** work, using a simple Robot Task Manager concept.

 ---

## 🚀 What is This Project?

Imagine telling a robot:  
> "Hey robot, when I clap, you should either **dance**, **sing**, or **wave** — depending on what I tell you."

That "instruction" is a **delegate** in C#.  
It helps you point to a method, store it, and execute it later.

This mini-project is designed to help beginners understand delegates in a playful and practical way.
